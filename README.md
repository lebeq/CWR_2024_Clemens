# CWR 2024

This repository contains the course work from the 'Computergest√ºtztes Wissenschaftliches Rechnen' lecture by Prof. S. Manmana held in the summer semester 2024.
Each numbered directory contains the solution to an exercise, along with a plotting file and makefile. The MyNumerics directory contains the self written numerical methods developed during the semester.

## The makefiles

To execute the C code use 
```
make clean
make all
```
`Note`: under windows there might be issues with the LGSL library and this might not work, depending on the setup. Everything was done on Linux.
To generate the plots use
```
make plot
```
`Note`: This uses the comand python file.py. Depending on the setup, one might have to use python3 file.py.
